## The price analysis of KMR company. 

Diagram and histogram of prices in 2022. Calculated statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis). Parameter estimation of normal distribution, log-normal distribution and weibull distribution. Comparing them using diagnostic charts (qq plot, cdf). Testing the distribution hypothesis with Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. The best for KMR prices is LN. 

## Analysis of the cumulative distribution of log-returns KMR and JJB
The first stage is doing exactly the same as in first stage but with logs of prices. The second is fitting  two-dimensional distribution for data. Distribution matching analysis with Mahalanobis distances, in result, distribution of log-returns not normal

## Regression
On base of log-return is perfomed lenear regression
